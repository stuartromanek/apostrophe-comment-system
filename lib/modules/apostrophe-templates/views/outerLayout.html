{#
  An empty global layout to be extended by your page templates. This file extends
  Apostrophe's outerLayoutBase template, which we don't recommend overriding, unless
  you're a pro!

{% extends "outerLayoutBase.html" %}

{% block title %}Apostrophe Boilerplate{% endblock %}

{% block extraHead %}
  {#
    This block outputs its contents in the HTML document's <head>.
    It is a good place to put <script> <link> and <meta> tags.
  #}
{% endblock %}

{% block beforeMain %}
  {#
    We recommend you use the beforeMain block for global page components
    like headers or navigation.
  #}
{% endblock %}

{% block main %}
  {#
    Usually, your page templates in the apostrophe-pages module will override
    this block. It's safe to assume this is where your page-specific content
    should go.
  #}
{% endblock %}

{% block afterMain %}
  {#
    This would be a great place to put a footer.
  #}
{% endblock %}
